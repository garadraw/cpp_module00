cin		Standard input stream (object)
cout	Standard output stream (object)
cerr	Standard output stream for errors (object)
clog	Standard output stream for logging (object)

Wide characters (wchar_t)

wcout	Standard output stream (wide) (object)
wcerr	Standard output stream for errors (wide-oriented) (object)
wclog	Standard output stream for logging (wide) (object)
